# Global System-Wide EQ Testing Guide

## 🎛️ What Changed

Your EQ is now **GLOBAL SYSTEM-WIDE** - it affects ALL audio on your Android device:
- Spotify, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, system sounds, etc.
- Works even when your app is closed (foreground service)
- Uses Android's native Equalizer with session ID 0 (global)

## 🧪 How to Test

### 1. Build and Run
```bash
flutter run
```

### 2. Check Service Started
- Look for notification: "Global EQ Active"
- Check Android logcat for: `✅ Global Equalizer initialized`

### 3. Test with Your App
1. Open EQ screen in your app
2. Adjust EQ sliders (try Bass Up preset)
3. Play music in your app - should sound different

### 4. Test with Spotify/Other Apps
1. Keep your EQ app running in background
2. Open Spotify (or YouTube, any music app)
3. Play music - **IT SHOULD HAVE THE SAME EQ APPLIED!**
4. Go back to your app, change EQ preset
5. Return to Spotify - sound should change immediately

### 5. Test Persistence
1. Close your EQ app completely
2. Music in other apps should STILL have EQ applied
3. Check notification tray - "Global EQ Active" should still be there

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### No EQ Effect
- Check Android Settings > Apps > PURE HD Audio > Permissions
- Ensure "Modify audio settings" is granted
- Some phones need "Auto-start" permission in battery settings

### Service Not Starting
- Check logcat for error messages
- Try restarting the app
- Some OEM ROMs (Samsung, Xiaomi) may block audio modification

### EQ Not Affecting Other Apps
- Verify session ID is 0 in logs: `Session ID: 0 (global)`
- Some apps (like system media player) might override EQ
- Try different apps: Spotify, YouTube Music, SoundCloud

## 📱 Android Logcat Messages to Look For

**Success:**
```
🎛️ GlobalEQService created
✅ Global Equalizer initialized successfully
   Session ID: 0 (global)
   Number of bands: 5 (or more)
🎛️ Applying global EQ settings: [0.0, 3.0, ...]
✅ Global EQ settings applied successfully
```

**Errors:**
```
❌ Failed to initialize Global Equalizer: [reason]
❌ Failed to apply EQ settings: [reason]
```

## ✅ Expected Results

- **Your app music**: Has EQ applied
- **Spotify/YouTube**: Has SAME EQ applied  
- **System sounds**: May have EQ applied
- **Phone calls**: Usually not affected (different audio path)
- **Notification sounds**: May have EQ applied

## 🎯 This is EXACTLY What You Wanted!

Your EQ now works like professional EQ apps:
- Global system-wide effect
- Persistent when app is closed
- Affects all media apps
- Android native implementation
- Foreground service keeps it alive

Test it and let me know if Spotify gets the EQ effect! 🎧
